This is an expirement, a handy light CMS system that I will start to use for a blog. It's done in cakePHP version 2.3.5

Set up stuff
----------------

* remember to create this folder: /app/webroot/fotos and add it to your .gitignore, this is where the uploaded photos for articles will go, also give it 775 permissions (chmod -R 775)

TO DO: add more details here.
