WataCMS
=======

This is an expirement, a handy light CMS system that I will start to use for a blog. It's done in cakePHP version 2,3.5

Set up stuff
----------------

* remember to create this folder: /app/webroot/fotos and add it to your .gitignore, this is where the uploaded photos for articles will go
* also you need to create a folder called cache in /app/webroot/files/ and set permissions to 775 there, this is so that we can use timthumb on this project.
